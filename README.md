# Rock vs Mine Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether an object is a rock or a mine using radar image data.
The goal is to build a machine learning model that can classify each sample correctly.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset is taken from Kaggle.  
It contains radar data with features corresponding to different observations.

## 🚀 Approach
- Load and explore the dataset
- Perform necessary preprocessing
- Train a classification model
- Evaluate model performance

## 🧠 Algorithms Used
Mention the model(s) used, for example:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest

## 📈 Results
Include accuracy, classification report, etc.
